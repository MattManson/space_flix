# space_flix

Our group has created a web app that allows users to view and save images and videos from Nasa's Image and Video API. They can also hear a random space sound from Nasa's sound API as well as view the Astrological Picture of the Day (APOD API). This project was created using JavaScript, HTML, CSS and MongoDB.

Getting Started

New users need to first pull the code down from github and ensure that they have MongoDB as well as npm in order to install packages

Prerequisites

1. A text editor in order to view the code
2. Mongo DB installed
3. An internet connection of course!

Installing

1. Pull the code down off of github using "git clone" in the terminal
2. Open the backend code in a text editor.
3. Type npm install in terminal in order to install packages
4. Type npm start to run the server
5. Type mongod in terminal to ensure the database is connected
6. (optional) Type mongo < seeds.js in terminal to seed the database
7. Open the frontend folder and repeat steps 3 and 4 with the frontend files
8. Type npm run build to run webpack
9. Navigate to http://localhost:3000 to view the site

Using the site

1. From the main page, users can click on any of the headings in order to view the associated videos an images. Users can also use the search bar to find more niche videos. The main page also allows users to access the space sounds page and view their favourites.
2. From a topic page (eg. Mars) users can click on either a video or image to get more info. Clicking again on the image/video will either show an enlarged image or play the video in a popup. Uses can also save their favourite videos (ability to save images coming soon!)
3. The sounds page allows users to listen to a random space sound.
4. The favourites page allows users to view their favourite videos as well as delete their favourites.
